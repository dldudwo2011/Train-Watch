.NET5 - Query and CRUD functionality

This is a virtual website made with .NET 5 to do Query and CRUD Operation on various rail car companies. In addition, there is a Contact Us page to allow users to send a message as well as upload a CSV file to their details. There is also a View Contribution page that allows users to submit a CSV file and view it in a clearer form.

Please follow these steps to see my work working.

1. Import the dacpac file (TrainWatch) in your SQL Server Studio Management.
2. Run the server in visual studio with the src file provided and test the Query and CRUD functionality by clicking the View Contribution (Query) and Manage Rolling (CRUD) tabs in the menu.
3. In addition to Query and CRUD, you might be interested in exploring other tabs, such as Contact Us and View Contribution tab.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Query items from the database.
- CRUD functionality with the database.
- Implement pagination with the ability to select paging size.
- Implement filtered search by partial product name.
- Allow users to send contact messages as well as upload a CSV file.
